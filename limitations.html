<h2>Limitations and Challenges</h2>
<p>A key limitation of our approach was the restrictive context window and token limits of the LLMs,
    which constrained input lengths for prompts and subgraph serializations—particularly for larger
    k-hop neighborhoods. Since even k=1 or k=2 hops could contain many nodes and transactions,
    this meant that text serializations grew extremely fast. This, in turn, limited the number of few-shot examples we could include and
    the subgraph radius (k-hops), potentially reducing the quality and comprehensiveness of model judgments
    on complex laundering patterns. This may just be a limitation on the large language models available
    for us to use on this project as well as a limitation on the methodology of using text serializations of
    subgraphs.
